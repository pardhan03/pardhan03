### Hi there 👋, I’m @MANISHPARDHAN

- 📱 I build cross-platform mobile applications using React Native, delivering smooth and performant user experiences.
- 🌐 Comfortable working across the stack — I’m currently exploring backend development with Node.js and databases like MongoDB and Firebase to become a more complete full-stack developer.
- 💞️ I’ve made contributions to open-source projects and actively seek out new ones to collaborate on — I believe contributing to the community is a powerful way to grow and give back.
- 🔌 I have experience working with REST APIs, Firebase, Appwrite, and other backend services to power real-world apps
